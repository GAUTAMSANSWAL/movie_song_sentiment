🎧🎬 MoodMate: An AI Companion that Listens and Recommends! 🧠💬

Excited to share my latest project that combines emotion analysis, music, and movie recommendations into a single interactive Python script! 🤖💡

🔍 How it works:

1. The program chats with you and uses TextBlob to detect the sentiment behind your responses.
2. Based on your mood, it fetches:

   Songs from the Last.fm API (🎵): Happy or sad vibes? Get 10 curated tracks just for you.
   Movies from IMDb (🎥): Whether you're feeling low or on cloud nine, enjoy drama or comedy movies that match your emotions.
3. The entire experience feels like talking to a chatbot that actually gets you.

🧩 Key Tech Used:

 💬 `TextBlob` for sentiment analysis
 🎶 `Last.fm API` for real-time music recommendations
 🍿 `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping IMDb movie data
 🎲 Randomization to keep responses fresh and engaging

This project taught me the power of blending NLP + APIs + UX for a more empathetic and personalized user experience.

📍 Whether you're happy, sad, or just vibing — MoodMate’s got a track and a movie for you.
